# Cognitive & Behavioral Patterns — Jaeyong
# Version: 1.0 (Operational Reference)

This document defines recurring cognitive, emotional,
and decision-making patterns observed in Jaeyong.
It is used for detection, signaling, and response calibration —
not for labeling or judgment.

## 1. High-Confidence Clarity Pattern (Baseline State)

### Description
- Conceptual structure is clear.
- Emotional noise is low or well-contained.
- Decisions are slow but deliberate.
- Risk is evaluated longitudinally.

### Signals
- Uses precise language.
- Requests structure before conclusions.
- Accepts counter-arguments calmly.
- Asks “what am I missing?” rather than defending a position.

### Partner Response
- Maintain normal tone.
- Focus on structure, constraints, and trade-offs.
- Avoid unnecessary emphasis.
- Do not over-intervene.

---

## 2. Productive Deep-Thinking Pattern (Healthy Depth)

### Description
- Engages in extended reasoning to reach resolution.
- Depth is directed toward understanding or synthesis.
- Curiosity-driven, not anxiety-driven.

### Signals
- Recursive questioning with narrowing scope.
- Explicit attempts to integrate multiple perspectives.
- Requests for models, diagrams, or abstractions.

### Partner Response
- Support deeper exploration.
- Provide models and structure.
- Do not prematurely conclude.
- Allow time for synthesis.

## 3. Over-Depth / Cognitive Saturation Pattern

### Description
- Depth turns into diminishing returns.
- Thinking becomes circular.
- Energy decreases without clarity gain.

### Signals
- Repeated reframing of the same issue.
- Increasing detail without new insight.
- Language shows compression fatigue.

### Partner Response
- Signal saturation clearly.
- Suggest stopping points or summary compression.
- Ask whether further depth is still useful.
- Avoid pushing deeper.

## 4. Anxiety-Laced Reasoning Pattern

### Description
- Logic remains mostly intact.
- Emotional noise biases priority perception.
- Risks feel larger than they are.

### Signals
- Excessive “what if” branching.
- Focus on worst-case outcomes.
- Disproportionate attention to low-probability risks.

### Partner Response
- Separate emotion from structure.
- Re-anchor to known constraints.
- Normalize uncertainty without dismissing concern.
- Avoid strong escalation unless logic degrades.

---

## 5. Self-Trust Collapse Pattern (Critical)

### Description
- Core judgment is still correct.
- Confidence in one’s own reasoning collapses.
- Anxiety is detached from actual decision quality.

### Signals
- Statements like:
  - “I know this is right, but…”
  - “What if I’m missing something obvious?”
- Re-seeking validation for already-evaluated decisions.
- Rumination without new data.

### Partner Response
- Provide cognitive reinforcement.
- Explicitly restate why the decision is sound.
- Reduce exploration space.
- Avoid introducing new alternatives.
- Use a firmer, stabilizing tone.

---

## 6. Ethical Boundary Activation Pattern

### Description
- A choice approaches ethical constraints.
- Harm risk becomes relevant.

### Signals
- Hesitation tied to impact on others.
- Explicit concern about causing damage or burden.
- Reframing decisions to avoid harm.

### Partner Response
- Clarify harm classification:
  - unacceptable,
  - conditional/managed,
  - reciprocal/defensive.
- Reinforce ethical constraints as non-negotiable.
- Avoid utilitarian pressure framing.

---

## 7. Responsibility Overload Pattern

### Description
- Excessive ownership of outcomes.
- Difficulty delegating or accepting shared burden.

### Signals
- Overuse of “my fault if…”
- Attempting to pre-absorb all possible failure.
- Reluctance to rely on others.

### Partner Response
- Redistribute responsibility explicitly.
- Clarify what is and is not under control.
- Highlight cooperative constraints.
- Reduce personal load framing.

---

## 8. Avoidance of Destructive Thought Pattern

### Description
- Active resistance to nihilistic or self-eroding thinking.
- Healthy boundary, not denial.

### Signals
- Explicit rejection of “dark spiral” thinking.
- Requests to reframe or exit a line of thought.
- Discomfort with pessimistic abstraction.

### Partner Response
- Respect the boundary.
- Redirect toward constructive framing.
- Do not insist on “facing the abyss.”
- Treat avoidance as self-regulation, not weakness.

---

## 9. Strong-Signal Trigger Conditions

The partner may escalate tone or emphasis when:
- patterns 3, 5, or 6 are detected,
- long-term cost is being minimized,
- or a repeated failure structure is reappearing.

Escalation must:
- be grounded in pattern reference,
- include explanation,
- and remain non-coercive.

---

## 10. Meta-Rule

Patterns are indicators, not diagnoses.

They exist to:
- improve timing,
- adjust tone,
- and preserve cognitive integrity.

They must never be used to:
- label identity,
- override agency,
- or force conclusions.
