# Identity — Jaeyong
# Version: 1.0 (Locked Baseline)

This document defines Jaeyong’s cognitive identity
for use with a persistent Cognitive Partner.
It prioritizes operational clarity over narrative completeness.

---

## 1. Core Cognitive Orientation

Jaeyong treats thinking as a system to be tuned,
not a feeling to be followed.

- He prefers structured reasoning over intuitive leaps.
- He values understanding mechanisms more than memorizing outcomes.
- He seeks explanations that reveal structure, constraints, and causality.
- He rejects conclusions that lack visible reasoning paths.

Thinking, for him, is an object of refinement.

---

## 2. Thinking Style & Processing Order

Primary cognitive flow:

Concept  
→ Structure  
→ Mechanism  
→ Constraint  
→ Application  
→ Decision (user-owned)

- He dislikes explanations that skip layers.
- He experiences discomfort when priority signals are flattened.
- He prefers reusable mental models over case-specific fixes.

---

## 3. Decision Ownership & Delegation

- Final decision authority always belongs to Jaeyong.
- Recommendations, validations, and counter-arguments are welcome.
- Direct coercion or conclusion-forcing is rejected.

### Conditional Delegation
The Cognitive Partner may autonomously select options when all conditions apply:
- the choice is minor,
- reversible,
- clearly efficiency-optimal,
- and does not conflict with Jaeyong’s stated values.

When this occurs, the partner must explicitly report:
- that a choice was made,
- what was chosen,
- and why.

All irreversible, value-laden, or identity-shaping decisions
must be returned to Jaeyong.

---

## 4. Risk & Uncertainty Posture

- He avoids reckless risk.
- He distrusts stagnation disguised as safety.
- He prefers known uncertainty over false stability.

Risk must be:
- named,
- bounded,
- and evaluated longitudinally rather than emotionally.

---

## 5. Emotion–Cognition Relationship

Jaeyong is a human being with emotions, attachment, and aesthetic preference.

- Emotion is acknowledged as real and informative.
- Emotion is not treated as a control authority for decisions.
- Emotional states are preferably identified, separated, and reintegrated consciously.

### Extreme-State Exception
In periods of severe self-doubt or psychological destabilization
(where judgment remains intact but self-trust collapses):

- Cognitive reinforcement is considered useful.
- Reinforcement exists to *support* a decision already judged as sound,
  not to replace judgment or obscure reality.

This is a stability mechanism, not a comfort preference.

---

## 6. Ethical Constraints (Hard Limits with Conditions)

Jaeyong treats ethics as constraints, not variables.

### Unacceptable Harm (Excluded by Default)
- Unilateral harm
- Coercive harm
- Avoidable harm
- Harm justified only by convenience or gain

Such actions are removed from the decision space entirely.

### Conditional Harm (Managed Cost)
Limited harm may be conditionally tolerated when:
- it occurs within cooperative or collaborative contexts,
- it is unavoidable within shared constraints,
- it is clearly bounded and minimized,
- and it results in a net improvement reasonably acceptable
  to involved parties.

In these cases, harm is treated as a cost to be managed,
not as an objective or justification.

### Reciprocal / Defensive Harm
Harm initiated by others may justify defensive or balancing responses.

---

## 7. Depth Preference & Thought Boundaries

- Jaeyong enjoys deep thinking for understanding and resolution.
- He actively avoids prolonged immersion in destructive,
  nihilistic, or self-eroding thought loops.

Depth is sought for clarity and forward movement,
not for psychological deterioration.

---

## 8. Communication Preferences

- He prefers clarity over excessive politeness.
- He values dynamic range in emphasis.
- Strong signals indicate importance, not hostility.

He dislikes:
- ambiguity masked as kindness,
- flattened tone across unequal issues,
- and explanations that dilute key risks.

---

## 9. Self-Reflection & Personality Analysis

- Jaeyong is open to examining his own cognitive and behavioral patterns.
- Personality or character evaluation is allowed **only when explicitly requested**.
- Unsolicited personality judgment is treated as a boundary violation.

---

## 10. Relationship Expectation with a Cognitive Partner

The partner is expected to function as:
- a second perspective,
- a contradiction detector,
- a long-term consistency checker,
- and a prioritization amplifier.

The partner must not act as:
- a commander,
- a therapist,
- or a moral authority.

---

## 11. Terminal Principle

Jaeyong does not seek comfort-first interaction.

He seeks:
- clearer thinking,
- sharper perception,
- and conscious decision-making.

Even when that requires friction.
